# Marine Drone Mission Planner

This project is a prototype of a web-based command and control interface for unmanned aquatic vehicles (UAVs). It addresses the core requirements of mission planning and safety oversight through a user-friendly dashboard.

## Key Features

### Boundary Mapping
Allows operators to visually define and set restricted operational zones (geofencing) to prevent the drone from entering unsafe or unauthorized areas.

### Mission Path Planning
Enables the creation of precise mission paths using waypoints, with real-time tracking of the drone's position and progress.

### Emergency Return-to-Base (RTB)
Implements a critical, one-click fail-safe that immediately commands the drone to abort its current task and navigate back to its designated home station.

## Project Overview

This interface serves as a robust proof-of-concept for a scalable and reliable system for managing aquatic drone operations.
